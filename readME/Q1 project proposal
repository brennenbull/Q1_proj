Q1 Project:
Proposal: My Project shows the rate and size of meteorites that have been recorded or collected in the past 1600 years. This helps to show our relationship with the cosmos and the distribution of meteorite impacts over the planet. With this project I want to render a large data set into an interactive and relatable application.

Technology Used: Google Maps API, Data.gov API, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap.

MVP: Map meteorites using the google maps api and provide the user with a dynamic date filter. Make the map point size relative to the mass of the meteorite. Add other Graphical data representations to show meteors over time and meteor class distribution.

Stretch Goals: Swap graph position on page so the main window can be whichever data representation the user choses. Add css animations for chart and map transitions.

User Epic:
1: As as user I want to zoom in on a specific region and see how the meteors populate that region.

User Stories:
1: As a power user I want to filter meteor data by size and see specific data on meteor name and class.
